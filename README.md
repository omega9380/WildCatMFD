# WildCatMFD
 An attempt at an open-source equivalent to the Thrustmaster Cougar MFD.
 
 It's designed around a 7" Lebula touchscreen monitor (available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VNX4ZWY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) and the Teensy 3.6 board using the Teensyduino Joystick library. 
 
 I went with the Teensy 3.6 so all the keys are direct-connect so as to avoid needing to design a button matrix or use shift registers, mostly because I have no idea where to start with those :).  I may come up with a version 2 (or 3 or 4....) that uses a smaller MC.
 
 I'm new to KiCAD and electronics and figured this would be a way to learn.
 
 I want this to conform to the OSHW initiative.  The code will be under the GPL.
 
 Thanks!
